# This script attempts to process files in a directory,
# but it has a subtle bug related to how it handles
# filenames with spaces.

find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' file; do
  echo "Processing: $file"
  # ... some processing of $file ...
  if [[ "$file" == "*problem file.txt" ]]; then
    echo "Found problem file"
  fi
  # ... more processing ...
  # Potential issue: if a filename contains spaces, it will be split into multiple words
  # within the while loop, leading to unexpected behaviour or errors.
  # for example if there is a file named 'My Document.txt' this will be split into three words.

  # Solution: Use the safer way of processing a file as follow:
  # while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do 
  #   process "$file" 
  #   done < <(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0)
